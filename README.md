haxe-ammo.js 
==============================================
This is a collection of Haxe extern definitions for [Ammo.js](http://github.com/kripken/ammo.js)
which is a machine generated javascript version of Bullet 3D physics engine.

Currently, this is far from comprehensive as I'm only adding the parts that
I need. Any help is appreciated!
